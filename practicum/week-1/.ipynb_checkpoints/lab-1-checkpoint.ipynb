    "This year, we will run the practical exercises in Python, a powerful interpreted language. Python is being increasingly used in machine learning research, as it is fast, portable, has a clean syntax and sports a large collection of scientific software libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with the more advanced mathematics that we deal with in this course, we make use of a few python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* numpy, which allows us to work with vectors and matrices\n",
    "* scipy, which gives us access to scientific algorithms\n",
    "* matplotlib, which allows us to plot our results\n",
    "\n",
    "For this introduction, we will run our practical exercises within a \"*notebook*\": an interactive web page that integrates both code and text, allowing us to combine the code with documentation. In this case, you will edit this notebook to write your code and provide answers to the questions. Much of the documentation for python and its libraries can be found online. In particular, you should be able to do the exercises described in this document with the information available at http://scipy.org/docs.html\n",
